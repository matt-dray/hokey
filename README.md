_Merriam-Webster: 'corny, obviously contrived'._

Play in your terminal three small interactive games that require keypresses as input: `type()`, `adventure()` and `battle()`. Install with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/hokey")
```

A micro-demonstration of [the {keypress} package by Gábor Csárdi](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/keypress).

Run `keypress::has_keypress_support()` to see if your terminal is supported. Does not work in RStudio.
